	<li>Reschedule a step / revision<ul>
        <li>Abort a step: Click &#39;abort&#39;. Important: After clicking abort, the state will
            switch to &quot;aborted&quot;, but you must wait until the state has changed to &quot;issues&quot;
            or &quot;failed&quot; until doing anything else with that step (otherwise the bot will
            never realize you aborted it).</li>
        <li>Reschedule a step: Click &#39;clear&#39;. Don&#39;t do this after a revision has completed
            (i.e. cleaned up), the step will run again and fail (since everything has been
            deleted).</li>
        <li>Reschedule a revision: click &#39;reset work&#39;. Don&#39;t do this while a bot is working
            on the revision (you may abort all steps first to shortcurcuit a bit).</li>
        <li>TODO: make the web ui enforce all the &quot;Don&#39;t do this&quot;.</li>
        </ul>
