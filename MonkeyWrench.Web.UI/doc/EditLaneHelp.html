        Retention directives</h2>
    <div>
        Retention directives can be used to delete files according to some criteria. By default files are kept forever. All directives are executed regularily.
        <ul>
            <li>Directive: the name of the directive.</li>
            <li>Filename: the name of the file(s) to delete.</li>
            <li>Glob mode: how to match the filename specified in the directive against the name of the actual file.
                <ul>
                    <li>ShellGlob: a semi-colon separated list of shell globs.</li>
                    <li>RegExp: a regexp.</li>
                    <li>Exact: the match must be exact (even casing must match)</li></ul>
            </li>
            <li>Condition: which condition must match to delete the file
                <ul>
                    <li>AfterXDays:</li>
                    <li>AfterXBuiltRevisions:</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>X: the number to insert into the above Condition.</li>
        </ul><ul>
            <li>Add a new lane called &#39;mono-2.2&#39;</li>
            <li>Repository: the svn repository of the code you want to build. Multiple repositories
                can be separated by commas. This is used by the scheduler to fetch the revisions
                to build. The code you want to checkout doesn&#39;t have to be in this repository.
                Set it to (no spaces neither in the beginning nor at the end, with a comma in the
                middle):
                <pre>
svn://anonsvn.mono-project.com/source/branches/mono-2-2/mono,svn://anonsvn.mono-project.com/source/branches/mono-2-2/mcs
</pre>
            </li>
            <li>Set min revision to:
                <pre>
118442
</pre>
            </li>
            <li>Click Save.</li>
            <li>Now you need to create the commands you want your builder to execute. A minimal
                example would include checkout, make and cleanup.</li>
            <li>Now create three commands, named:
                <ul>
                    <li>checkout.sh</li>
                    <li>make.sh</li>
                    <li>cleanup.sh </li>
                    <li>For the cleanup.sh command, click on the &#39;no&#39; in the &#39;alwaysexecute&#39;
                        column, to switch it to &#39;yes&#39;. This makes the command execute always, even
                        if any of the previous commands failed.</li>
                    <li>The commands will be executed according to the &#39;sequence&#39; field, lowest
                        to highest. Two commands with the same sequence means the builder can execute them
                        simultaneously (won&#39;t necessarily do it though, in which case those commands
                        are executed in random order).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Now you need to put contents into the commands, or put another way, create the corresponding
                files for these commands.</li>
            <li>Create three files:
                <ul>
                    <li>checkout.sh</li>
                    <li>make.sh</li>
                    <li>cleanup.sh</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Edit each command (clicking on the name), and set their contents to:
                <ul>
                    <li>cleanup.sh:
                        <pre>
