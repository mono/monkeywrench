    <h1>
        Configuration</h1>
    <h2>
        Location</h2>
    The configuration is stored in a file called MonkeyWrench.xml (for both server and buildbots).<br />
    The file is searched for in the following locations (and in this order):
    <ol>
        <li>The environment variable MONKEYWRENCH_CONFIG_FILE (the full path of the file, which in this case does not have to be named 'MonkeyWrench.xml')</li>
        <li>The current directory</li>
        <li>~/.config/MonkeyWrench (linux only)</li>
        <li>/etc (linux only)</li>
        <li>MyDocuments folder (windows only)</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>
        Format</h2>
    MonkeyWrench.xml is an xml file with the following elements:
    <pre>
&lt;MonkeyWrench Version=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
    &lt;Configuration&gt;
        &lt;DataDirectory /&gt;
        &lt;DatabaseDirectory /&gt;
        &lt;Host /&gt;
        &lt;LogFile /&gt;
        &lt;WebServiceUrl /&gt;
        &lt;WebSiteUrl /&gt;
        &lt;ForceFullUpdate&gt;true|false&lt;/ForceFullUpdate&gt;
        &lt;WebServicePassword /&gt;
        &lt;DatabaseHost /&gt;
        &lt;DatabasePort /&gt;
        &lt;StoreFilesInDB /&gt;
        &lt;ConnectionRetryDuration /&gt;
        &lt;LockingAlgorithm /&gt;
        &lt;SchedulerAccount /&gt;
        &lt;SchedulerPassowrd /&gt;
        &lt;AllowedCommitReporterIPs /&gt;
        &lt;LogVerbosity /&gt;
        &lt;SiteSkin /&gt;
        &lt;UploadPort /&gt;
    &lt;/Configuration&gt;
&lt;/MonkeyWrench&gt;
</pre>
    All values can also be set with the equivalent (case insensitive) command line arguments (which override the configuration file)
    <h3>DataDirectory</h3>
    Data directory.<br />
    Defaults to ~/monkeywrench/data.<br />
    For buildbots: The directory of the build data.<br />
    For web server: The post commit hook reports are stored in this directory (in the commits subdirectory)<br />
    For database server: The files in the database are stored in this directory (in the db/files subdirectory)
    <h3>Host</h3>
    The name of the current host. Only relevant for buildbots (in which case it is required).
    <h3>LogFile</h3>
    The log file. Defaults to MonkeyWrench.log in the tmp directory (which is platform specific).
    <h3>WebServiceUrl</h3>
    The url (http://host[:port]/...) for the web service. Required for buildbots and web server.
    <h3>ForceFullUpdate</h3>
    Specifies if a full update should be performed on the database (as opposed to only update what was reported through post-commit hooks, etc).<br />
    Only relevant for database/web server. Defaults to true. Possible values: 'true' or 'false'
    <h3>WebServicePassword</h3>
    If required, a password to log into the web service.
    <h3>DatabaseDirectory</h3>
    <h3>DatabaseHost</h3>
    The host machine of the database. Defaults to 'localhost'.
    <h3>DatabasePort</h3>
    The port to use to connect to the database.
    <h3>StoreFilesInDB</h3>
    If files are to be stored in the database or in the file system on the server (in the db/files subdirectory of DataDirectory). Only relevant on the server (and will only have effect for new uploads, files won't be moved either way automatically)
    <h3>ConnectionRetryDuration</h3>
    If a connection to the server fails, the number of minutes the buildbot should keep trying before failing. Defaults to 1440 minutes (24 hours).
    <h3>LockingAlgorithm</h3>
    The locking algorithm to ensure only one process is running at the same time (used by buildbot and scheduler executables). Possible values (case doesn't matter):
    <ul>
        <li>File: A file is created on disk with a read/write lock (managed).</li>
        <li>Semaphore (default): A managed semaphore.</li>
        <li>Mutex: A managed mutex.</li>
        <li>FileExistence: A file is created on disk, and the mere presence of the file indicates that another process has a lock. This is not recommended unless all the other options fail, since if the process crashes or is killed, the lock won't get unlocked until somebody manually deletes the file. The file is created in the temporary directory with a descriptive name.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>SchedulerAccount and SchedulerPassword</h3>
    The credentials the scheduler program should use to connect to the web service. This user must be an Administrator. The default for SchedulerAccount is 'scheduler', while SchedulerPassword doesn't have a default.
    <h3>Platform</h3>
    The platform the buildbot is executing on. Possible values (case doesn't matter):
    <ul>
        <li>Empty string: Determine automatically (using PlatformID, which may fail some times, in particular it doesn't currently work on the Mac, which is detected as Linux)</li>
        <li>Mac</li>
        <li>Linux</li>
        <li>Windows</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>ChildProcessAlgorithm</h3>How child processes can be calculated from a parent process id. Possible values (case doesn't matter):
    <ul>
    <li>Empty string: Determine using the current platform (linux: pgrep, mac: ps, win32: N/A (win32 doesn't need to calculate child processes)</li>
    <li>pgrep</li>
    <li>ps</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>AllowedCommitReporterIPs</h3>The IPs that can report commits to ReportCommit.aspx or ReportGitHubCommit.aspx. Comma separated list of globs to accept.
    <h3>LogVerbosity</h3>How verbose the output to the log should be. Valid values: 0 (quiet), 1 (some output) or 2 (verbose). Default: 1.
    <h3>SiteSkin</h3>The skin used for the web site. Currently supported: moonlight or wrench. Defaults to none.
    <h3>WebSiteUrl</h3>The url for the web site. This is used to create proper links when notifications are sent. It defaults to the root directory of WebServiceUrl.
    <h3>UploadPort</h3>The port used at the web service for file uploads. Defaults to 0 (which means the web service will choose a port).
    <h2>
        Sample configuration</h2>
    This is a sample configuration file for a buildbot:
    <pre>
&lt;MonkeyWrench Version=&quot;2&quot;&gt; 
    &lt;Configuration&gt; 
        &lt;WebServiceUrl&gt;http://151.155.5.5/WebServices/&lt;/WebServiceUrl&gt;
        &lt;WebServicePassword&gt;sample-password&lt;/WebServicePassword&gt;
        &lt;Host&gt;sample-buildbot&lt;/Host&gt;
        &lt;DataDirectory&gt;/home/builder/monkeywrench/data&lt;/DataDirectory&gt;
    &lt;/Configuration&gt;
&lt;/MonkeyWrench&gt;
